# Customer-Shopping-Behavior-Analysis
Data analytics project showcasing customer shopping behavior using Python, SQL and PowerBI.
Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying, dashboard development, and reporting.
The goal is to extract actionable insights from raw data and present them clearly through visualizations and reports suitable for business decision-making.

Dataset

Source: Public

Format: CSV / Excel

Description:
The dataset contains structured records used to analyze trends, patterns, and key performance indicators (KPIs). It includes both numerical and categorical variables relevant to the analysis objectives.

Tools & Technologies

Python: Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

SQL: Data querying and aggregation

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Power BI: Interactive dashboard and data visualization

Gamma: Presentation (PPT) creation

Jupyter Notebook: Analysis documentation

Project Steps
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Verified data structure, data types, and basic statistics.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.

Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Generated visual summaries to guide cleaning and analysis.

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values and duplicates.

Standardized column names and data formats.

Prepared clean data for SQL analysis and visualization.

4. SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server.

Wrote SQL queries for:

Aggregations and KPIs

Trend analysis

Ranking and filtering

Validated SQL results against Python analysis.

5. Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:

Key metrics and trends

Comparisons across categories

Filters for dynamic exploration

6. Reporting & Presentation

Created a structured analytical report summarizing:

Objectives

Methodology

Key insights

Recommendations

Designed a professional PPT using Gamma for stakeholder presentation.

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive overview of the analysis, enabling users to:

Track key performance indicators

Identify trends and patterns

Drill down into specific segments

(Include screenshots or a Power BI link if available)

Results & Insights

Identified key trends and performance drivers within the dataset.

Highlighted areas of improvement and opportunities based on data patterns.

Delivered insights in a clear, visual, and decision-oriented format.
