*Data analytics project showcasing customer shopping behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI.*

This project demonstrates my end-to-end data analytics workflow — from raw data ingestion to insights communication. I used Python for data exploration and cleaning, SQL for querying and analysis, Power BI for visualization, and Gamma to create a final presentation.

The goal of this project is to showcase my ability to work across multiple tools, analyze data effectively, and communicate insights clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Dataset

The dataset was loaded and processed using Python.

It contains structured data suitable for exploratory data analysis, cleaning, and SQL-based querying.

Data quality issues such as missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting errors were identified and handled during preprocessing.


Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)

Power BI (Data modeling & dashboard creation)

Gamma (Presentation design)

Jupyter Notebook

Git/GitHub

Project Steps

1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Performed initial inspection to understand structure, size, and data types.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.

Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Generated summary statistics and visual insights.

3. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing values and duplicates.

Standardized column names and formats.

Prepared clean datasets for SQL analysis and visualization.

4. SQL Analysis

Loaded the cleaned data into PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server.

Wrote SQL queries to answer business questions and extract insights.

Used aggregations, filtering, joins, and calculated metrics.

5. Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Created KPIs, charts, and filters for easy exploration.

Designed the dashboard with clarity and usability in mind.

6. Reporting & Presentation

Documented key insights and findings in a written report.

Designed a professional presentation using Gamma to communicate results clearly.

Focused on storytelling, insights, and actionable conclusions.

Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:

High-level KPIs for quick insight

Interactive filters and drill-downs

Clear visual representation of trends and patterns
